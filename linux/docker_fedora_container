Note for running a Fedora container

Problem: 
Starting an sshd will get an "Failed to get D-Bus connection: No connection to service manager." error

Solution:
The trick is to configure sshd to be started as service by systemd

1- first install openssh-server and systemd
2- run "systemctl enable sshd.service" to enable the sshd service
3- save the container into an image
4- start a new container from the previously saved image to the /usr/sbin/init command:

  docker run --privileged -d -ti -e "container=docker" -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup scchan:fedora_22 /usr/sbin/init

The -e "container=docker" looks like to be some secret environment variable 
The -v ...   maps /sys/fs/cgroup into the container which is needed by systemd

5- find out the IP address of the container and ssh into it
