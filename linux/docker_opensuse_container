Note for running a Fedora container


To add extra option to the Docker daemon

1- Open "/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service"
2- Change the line with ExecStart= into

# container size 30GB, docker image store in /home/docker/docker instead of /var/lib/docker
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -g /home/docker/docker --storage-opt dm.basesize=30G




Problem: 
Starting an sshd will get an "Failed to get D-Bus connection: No connection to service manager." error

Solution:
The trick is to configure sshd to be started as service by systemd

1- first install openssh and systemd-sysvinit
2- save the container into an image
3- start a new container from the previously saved image to the /usr/sbin/init command:

  docker run --privileged -d -ti -e "container=docker" -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup scchan:fedora_22 /sbin/init

The -e "container=docker" looks like to be some secret environment variable 
The -v ...   maps /sys/fs/cgroup into the container which is needed by systemd

5- find out the IP address of the container and ssh into it
